## `Exceptions`

By default, the library uses exceptions to report errors. Exception messages are prefixed with the location of where the exception was thrown. Usually exception messages have enough information regarding the error and exceptions are rarely nested.

Exceptions thrown by the library are always of type `noa::Exception`, which inherits from `std::exception`. However, other exceptions, which all inherits from `std::exception`, can be thrown by the C++ runtime, e.g. `std::bad_alloc`, although these are very rare...

Exceptions thrown by the library are nested exceptions, which can be useful if the application also uses nested exceptions. The library provides a way to unroll all nested exceptions via the `noa::Exception::backtrace()` static function. Note that this function works with any `std::nested_exception`.


## `Error policy`

Exceptions can be turned off using the CMAKE build option [`NOA_ERROR_POLICY`](../cmake/ProjectOptions.cmake). This is intended to reduce the amount of code generated due to nested exceptions. The "abort" mode is particularly lean since it generates a single instruction, and it can be used on GPU code, for instance to bound-check on the GPU in Release mode.
